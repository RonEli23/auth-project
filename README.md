# Authentication Project

This project is a full-stack application that combines both client-side and server-side functionality to create a secure and role-based authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The main goal of this project is to provide a robust authentication mechanism that allows users to securely register, login, and access specific resources based on their assigned roles.

## Features

- JWT Authentication: Implements JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and authorization.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Enables role-based access control to regulate access to specific resources based on user roles.
- Secure Password Management: Ensures safe storage of user passwords using industry-standard encryption methods.
- Protected Routes: Includes protected routes on the client-side, accessible only to authenticated users with the appropriate roles.
- Light/dark mode toggle
